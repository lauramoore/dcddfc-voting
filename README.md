# dcddfc-voting
Collect, Count, Display voting on drunken debates at Dragon*Con

We want to provide a mobile voting app to assit in tallying audience voting in an open,live event.

A key requriment is that wi-fi and cell networks are notoriously poor signal throughout Dragon*Con so for this event we will
need to run it on local hardware, connected to a local Wi-Fi network and provide for a public hotspot that attendees can
access in order to install and vote on the app....

So if you've got an interest in Hardware, Local Ops,  and Devops ..  please join!

We also have quite a tight release cycle.  Dragon*Con will happen Labor Day Weekend.

This means that iterations need to stay focused.
